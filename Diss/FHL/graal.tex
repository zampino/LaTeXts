%\section{Nilpotent Lie algebras}
We are working in  $\nla{n}{}=\nla{n}(\Fp)$ the category of Lie Algebras over the field $\Fp$ which are nilpotent of class $n$.
 objects $M\in\nla{n}$ such that $M=\gen{M_{1}}$, for $M_{1}$ a free $\Fp$-module in $M$. We obtain a natural graduation of $M$ according to the \emph{commutator weight}, that is
$M=\oplus_{i\leq n}M_{i}$, where $M_{i}$ denote the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$-\emph{homogeneous component} of $M$, the $\Fp$-vector subspace of $M$ generated by all Lie products of $M_{1}$-weight $i$.

With $M^k$ we name the $k$-th term of the \emph{lower central chain} of $M$, namely the ideal
$M^k=\sum_{k\leq j}M_j$.
%We will always assume $A_{1}$ to be a free $\Fp$ module and $A=\gen{A_1}^{A}$ forevery $A\in\nla{n}$.

With $\fla{n}{X}$ we denote the \emph{free $n$-nilpotent Lie Algebra} over $\Fp$ with set of generators $X$.
