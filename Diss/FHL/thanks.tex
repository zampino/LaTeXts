My first thought goes to my advisor, mostly for the patience he demonstrated in this very long path.
Without his ideas indeed, very few of the present work could exist.

What this thesis {\em has not become}, is the result of a creative struggle between us, which unfortunately
failed in achieve the full score.

Of course I wish to thank a lot my tutor Martin Hils, which always tried to give me the motivations to go on.
I owe him a lot.

I want to thank Assaf Hasson and Misha Gavrilovich for the discussions about the possible homological implications.
