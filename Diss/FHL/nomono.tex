In the forthcoming sections the functor constructed above will essentially be applied to the following situation:
consider an $\nla{c-1}$-subalgebra $H$ of $M\in\nla{c-1}$ and the inclusion $i\colon H\inn M$.
Denote by $\gamma$ the lifted morphism $\frl(i)$.

We identify $\fla{c}{H_{1}}$ with the $\nla{c}$-subalgebra $\gena{H_{1}}{\fla{c}{M_{1}}}$ of $\fla{c}{M_{1}}$.

Now consider the $\nla{c}$-presentations $\gen{H_{1}\mid\J(H)}$ and $\gen{M_{1}\mid\J(M)}$ for $\fl H=\frl(H)$ and $\fl M=\frl(M)$
respectively.
Since $H$ is an $\nla{c-1}$-subalgebra of $M$, we may consider $\J(H)$ as a subspace of $\fla{c}{M_{1}}$ with
$\J(H)\inn\fla{c}{H_{1}}\cap\J(M)$. By Proposition \ref{morphifreelift} the map $\gamma$ coincides with
\begin{align}\label{gam}
\lmap{\gamma%{H}{M}
=\frl(i)}{\fl H}{&\fl M}\\\notag
w+\J(H)\longmapsto & \,w+\J(M)
\end{align}
%sending $w+\J(H)$ to $w+\J(M)$,
for all $w$ in $\fla{c}{H_{1}}$.

As a consequence we get
\begin{rem}\label{sangalgano} With the above considerations about notations
\begin{labeq}{kerfli}
\ker(\gamma)=(\fla{c}{H_{1}}\cap\J(M))/\J(H).
\end{labeq}

\medskip
Moreover if $M$ is $\fla{c-1}{M_{1}}/R$ then $H=\fla{c-1}{H_{1}}/R\cap\fla{c-1}{H_{1}}$ and hence for all $i<c$, by \pref{homojei}
we have $(\fla{c}{H_{1}}\cap\J(M))_{i}=\J(H)_{i}$. It follows
$\ker(\gamma)$ is a homogeneous ideal of total weight $c$, that is $\ker(\gamma)$ is contained in $(\fl H)_{c}$.
\end{rem}

\medskip
We illustrate below how the free-lift functor actually doesn't preserve -- in general -- embeddings. This example and
the result which follows concern the particular case of lifting $\nla{2}$-algebras.
\begin{rem}\label{nonmono}
There are extensions of $\nla{2}$-algebras $M\nni H$, such that the map $\gamma$ of $\fl H$ into $\fl M$, defined in
\pref{gam} is not injective.
\end{rem}
\begin{proof}
Consider an algebra $M$ of $\nla{2}$ given by the presentation $M=\gen{M_{1}\mid\rd(M)}$, where $M_{1}$ is freely generated
by the $\Fp$-base $$\mathcal{B}=\{a,u,x,y,z,h_{1},\dots,h_{4},e_{1},\dots,e_{4}\}$$
and $\rd(M)$ is the span in $\exs M_{1}$ of the following linearly independent relators:
\begin{gather*}
\begin{split}
[h_{1},h_{2}]+[x,a],\\
[h_{3},h_{4}]+[a,u],
\end{split}\quad
\begin{split}
[z,y]+[u,x],\\
[e_{1},e_{2}]+[y,a],\\
[e_{3},e_{4}]+[a,z].
\end{split}
\end{gather*}
Let $H_{1}$ denote the subspace of $M_{1}$ generated by
$\mathcal{B}\non\{a\}$ in $M_{1}$.
Now consider the following homogeneous sum of weight $3$ in $\fla{3}{M_{1}}$:
\begin{align*}
[[h_{1},h_{2}]&+\uline{[x,a],u]}+\\
[[h_{3},h_{4}]&+\uline{[a,u],x]}+\\
\uline{[[z,y],a]}&+\uline{[[u,x],a]}+\\
[[e_{1},e_{2}]+\uline{[y,a],z]}&+\\
[[e_{3},e_{4}]+\uline{[a,z],y]}.&
\end{align*}
By definition, this lays in $\J(M)$, but after deleting Jacobi sums it is also equal to
$$
w:=[h_{1},h_{2},u]+[h_{3},h_{4},x]+[e_{1},e_{2},z]+[e_{3},e_{4},y]
$$
and hence belongs to $\fla{3}{H_{1}}$. By $\pref{kerfli}$, now $\bar w\in \fl H$ is a non-zero element of $\ker(\gamma)=(\fla{3}{H_{1}}\cap\J(M))/
\J(H)$ since $w\notin\J(H)$.
\end{proof}
