{\bf Motivations}
\begin{itemize}
\item[] '88 E.Hrushowski confutes Zil'ber trichotomy, exhibiting a strongly minimal
non locally modular structure with no groups, hence no fields. It was a Fra\"iss\'e amalgamation of relations mediated by a ``deficiency'' function between points and relations
$\delta(A)=\card{A}-\card{R(A)}$
\item[]'96 Baudisch constructs a Morley rank-$2$ Group with a non locally modular geometry with no fields. The $\delta$ argument is adapted to counting {\em generators} minus {\em relators}.
\item[]In both cases ``no field interpreted'' is a consequence of being $CM$-trivial. This property seems to be shared by all known FH-amalgam construction. [Wagner, Blossier, Pizarro]

{\bf Groups vs. Lie algebras}
\begin{itemize}
\item[]If we look for a FMR group with no field interpreted
then it must have a precise structure as the following result prescribes
%\end{itemize}
\begin{teo*}
Let $G$ be a connected group of finite Morley rank, which doesn't interpret a field,
then $G$ is a central product of a definable abelian subgroup $A$ and
a nilpotent one $B$ of bounded exponent.
\end{teo*}
%\begin{itemize}
\item[]Thereafter a reasonable class we may look at is the variety of groups $\mathfrak{N}_{c}
\cap\mathfrak{B}_{p}$: prime exponent $p$ and nilpotent of class $c$.

To be able to {\em count relations} we switch to dimension-friendly Lie algebras
after the standard correspondence
$$\mathfrak{N}_{c}\cap\mathfrak{B}_{p}\leftrightsquigarrow
\mathfrak{L}_{c,\,p}$$
%\nla{c,p}$$ %(\Fp)$$
$\mathfrak{L}_{c,\,p}$ stands for a suitable subcategory of graded Lie algebras of nilpotency class 
$c$ over the field with $p$ elements.

In one direction, for  any group $G$, the lower central filtration $(\gamma_{i}(G))_{i<\omega}$ induces a Lie ring $L_{G}=\bigoplus_{i<\omega}S^{i}$ for $S^{i}=\gamma_{i}(G)\quot\gamma_{i+1}(G)$
and Lie multiplication induced by the group commutator $[\,\,,\,\,]\colon S^{i}\wedge S^{j}\rightarrow S^{i+j}$.
In particular, as a ring $L_{G}$ is generated by the subgroup $S^{1}=G_{ab}$.

On the other hand, the Campbell-Baker-Haussdorf formula, produces a group $G^{L}$ from a given Lie Algebra $L$ (here is crucial $p>c$).

\item[]We require elements $M=M_{1}\oplus\cdots\oplus M_{c}$ of $\mathfrak{L}_{c,\,p}$
to be generated, as rings by the lowest-weight homogeneous $\Fp$-subspace, i.{}e. $M=\gen{M_{1}}$. We call $H$ a subalgebra of $M$ if $H=\gena{H_{1}}{M}$
for some vector subspace $H_{1}$ of $M_{1}$.
\end{itemize}

\indent
{\bf Modo Inductivo}
\begin{itemize}
\item[]{\em If} the nil-$2$ case works fine, and a (pre-) dimension ($\delta_{2}$) $d_{2}$ is constructed, for a nil-$3$ graded structure $M=M_{1}+M_{2}+M_{3}$ we will define a predimension for nil-$3$ algebras as
follows $$\delta_{3}M=d_{2}(M/M_{3})-\text{``{\em new} relators for $M_{3}$''}$$


Along the same line, for an arbitrary nilpotency class $c$,
we aim at obtaining: $\delta_{c-1}\rightsquigarrow d_{c-1}\rightsquigarrow\delta_{c}$. The corresponding geometries should arrange in extensions $\cl_{2}\inn\cl_{3}\inn\dots\inn\cl_{c}%\inn\dots\inn\cl_{p}
$ for a fixed prime $p$.
\end{itemize}
%\indent
%{\bf nil-$2$ to nil-$3$}

\begin{itemize}
\item[]%Recall the construction for the nil-$2$ case so call $\nla{2}(\Fp)$ our bi-graded
For $M\in\mathfrak{L}_{c,\,p}$ and a finite $H_{1}\inn M_{1}$ we define the {\em deficiency}
$$\delta_{2}(H_{1})=\dfp H_{1}-\dfp\left(
\exs H_{1}\cap N^{2}(M)\right)$$
if $M=M_{1}+M_{2}$ is {\em presented} by the free nil-$2$
algebra $\fla{2}{M_{1}}=M_{1}+\exs M_{1}(\in\mathfrak{L}_{2,\,p})$ modulo a {\em relators} ideal $N^{2}(M)$
which is homogeneous of weight $2$:
%$$\delta_{2}M=\dfp M_{1}-\dfp N^{2}(M)$$
$$M=M_{1}\oplus\exs M_{1}\quot N^{2}(M).$$


This is an isomorphism invariant of finitely generated algebras, since also
for $H=\gena{H_{1}}{M}$, $N^{2}(H)$ {\em equals} $\exs H_{1}\cap N^{2}(M)$.

This integer valued function $\delta_{2}$ is a {\em predimension}, a notion of {\em self-sufficient
closure} also follows, along with the attached dimension $d_{2}$ and pregeometry $\cl_{2}$ which actually
depend on the fixed structure, say $M$, we take into account. If needed hence write $d_{2}^{M}$and this
function reads finite subspaces of $M_{1}$. 

It has to be remarked that all the Hrushowski-Fra\"iss\'e machinery actually takes place on the {\em definable} set $M_{1}$
(in particular $M_{1}$ is the domain for the pregeometry $\cl_{2}$ induced by $\delta_{2}$)
so actually all the relevant definitions are referred to $M_{1}$. We choose indeed language
$\La_{ring}%\cup\{\lambda_{k}:k<p\}
\cup\{P_{1},\,P_{2},\,\dots,\,P_{c}\}$ for $\nl{c}$.
\item[]We have a notion of {\em strong embedding} $M\zsu L$ ($\delta_{2}$ has minimum
in $M_{1}$ among the subspaces of $L_{1}$ which contain $M_{1}$).

Construct the $\zsu$-homogeneous {\em rich} monster $\K^{2}$ whose age are the finitely generated objects of $\Kl^{2}$, the class formed essentially by ``locally'' positive-deficiency algebras:
$$\Kl^{2}=\{M\in\nla{2}\mid \triv\zsu M\}$$

{\em Uncollapsed} axiomatisation of $T^{2,\omega}=th(\K^{2})$ is made possible by ``asymmetric'' amalgamation, while
description of types is performed along the ``ab initio'' style evaluating the geometric
dimension $d_{2}$ arising from $\delta_{2}$. The uncollapsed axiomatization needs also a notion
of $n$-strongness, this provides an $\omega$-saturated model {\em infinite}
$d_{2}$-dimension, since it embeds strongly free $n$-generated algebras for
all $n<\omega$.
\end{itemize}

\indent
{\bf Relevant Relators in $\mathfrak{L}_{3,\,p}$}
\begin{itemize}
\item[]We concetrate on case nil-$3$, although the following definitions make sense
for higher nilpotency class as well.

Let $\mathfrak{L}_{3,\,p}\ni M=M_{1}+M_{2}+M_{3}=\fla{3}{M_{1}}\quot R$.

We want to isolate relations in $R_{3}$ which do really count -- read, don't arise from
relations in weight $2$ trough Lie brackets -- in order to compute their occurrences without
{\em repetitions}.

We define a ``left inverse'' to the natural
projection $\nl{3}\to\nl{2}$ which sends $M\mapsto M_{*}:=M\quot M_{3}$.

We mean a ``free lift'' map $\map{{\sf fl}}{\mathfrak{L}_{2,\,p}}{\mathfrak{L}_{3,\,p}}$ which sends
$$M\mapsto\fla{3}{M_{1}}\quot\J(M)$$ for $\J(M)$
%=N^{2}+[\fla{3}{M_{1}},N^{2}]$
the ideal of $\fla{3}{M_{1}}$ generated by
$N^{2}$ if $M=\fla{2}{M_{1}}\quot N^{2}$ i.{}e. $\J(M)=N^{2}+[\fla{3}{M_{1}},N^{2}]$.
Note that, even though $R$ lays in $\fla{2}{M_{1}}$, it may be
considered as an homogeneous additive subspace of $\fla{3}{M_{1}}$.

$\fl M$ satisfies the {\em universal property}: $(\fl M)_{*}=M$ and for any
$L\in\nla{3}$ with $L_{*}\simeq M$ (hence $L_{1}\simeq M_{1}$) we have
$\fl M\onto L$.

\item[]Define $F_{M}:=\fl {M_{*}}$ and obtain an
{\em induced presentation}
$$N^{3}(M)\hookrightarrow F_{M}\onto M$$
so that we may define,
for finitely generated algebras $M$ a new invariant deficiency
$$\delta_{3}(M)=\delta_{2}(M_{*})-\dfp N^{3}(M).$$

%Therefore the canonical map $\gamma_{\sss B}^{\sss A}$ where $B$ is a subalgebra of $A$,
%is to be understood as $\map{\gamma_{\sss B}^{\sss A}}{\flt{B}}{\flt{A}}$ if
%$A,B\in\nla{2}$ or $\map{\gamma_{\sss B}^{\sss A}}{\ftr{B}}{\ftr{A}}$
%or also $\map{\gam{B}{A}}{\ft{B}}{\ft{A}}$ if $A,B\in\nla{3}$.

\item[]The functor ${\sf fl}$ ``does not preserve embeddings'': if we consider the natural map
$\frl(i)=:\gam{M}{L}\colon F_{M}\to F_{L}$, this is not necessarily injective
for extensions $i\colon M\inn L$.%For subalgebra we mean $M=\gena{M_{1}}{L}$ for some subspace $M_{1}$ of $L_{1}$.

%The map above is natural since ${\gena{M_{1}}{F_{L}}}_{*}=M_{*}$.
Since ${\gena{M_{1}}{F_{L}}}_{*}=M_{*}$, we have $Im(\gam{M}{L})=\gena{M_{1}}{F_{L}}$ and $\ker(\gam{M}{L})=F^{3}(M_{1})\cap
\J(L)\quot\J(M)$.

\item[]It seems indeed more effective to define a {\em relative} deficiency depending
on the ambient structure $M$. For $H_{1}\inn M_{1}$:
$$\ded^{M}(H_{1})=d^{M}_{2}H_{1}-\dfp N^{3}_{M}(H_{1})$$

where by $N^{3}_{M}(H_{1})$ we mean $N^{3}(M)\cap\gena{H_{1}}{F_{M}}=\gam{H}{M}
(N^{3}(H))$ since $\gam{H}{M}\pam{M}=\pam{H}$.
%then $N_{M}^{3}(H_{1})$ is the full image
%under $\gam{H}{M}$ of $N^{3}(H)$ also
Also note $N^{3}(H)\nni\ker\gam{H}{M}$.

\item[]But we have first a good behaviour of $\fl{}$ on strong $\delta_{2}$-embeddings:

\begin{lem*}$M\zsu L\Rightarrow F_{M}\hookrightarrow F_{L}$
%Let $A\quot B$ be a strong extension of $\nla{2}$-algebras, then
%$\gam{B}{A}$ is a Lie monomorphism of $\flt{B}$ into $\flt{A}$ with image
%$\gena{B_{1}}{\flt{A}}$.
\end{lem*}

%   ########################################################################
%  ####### SHORTEN AND RETYPE INTO A NEW FILE ``SKETCH.tex''   ##############
% #######################################################################	

By the embedding lemma above
it follows that $\ded^{M}=\ded^{L}$ for all strong extensions $M\zsu L$.
Moreover $\ded^{M}$ and $\delta_{3}$ do agree on finite $2$-strong algebras of $M$.

%This choice is also motivated by this definition of $H\dsu M$:
We define $3$-strongness of $H$ in $M$, $H\dsu M$ if
\begin{itemize}
\item $H\zsu M$
\item $\ded^{M}(u\quot H)\geq0$ for all finite $u$ in $M_{1}$
\end{itemize}
\item[]The next step is to show the finite objects of
$$\Kl^{3}=\{M\in\nla{3}\mid M_{*}\in\Kl^{2},\;\triv\dsu M\}$$
satisfy amalgamation property.

The following lemma ensures the class above
is first order axiomatisabile
\begin{lem*}
Let $L\in\nla{3}$ with $L_{*}\in\Kl^{2}$, then  $L\in\Kl^{3}$ if and only
if $\delta_{3}(H)\geq0$ for all finite $H\inn L$.
\end{lem*}

And this is essentially because, sort of unexpectedly, $\ded$ and $\delta_{3}$
are actually comparable.
\begin{lem*}
For any $L\in\nla{3}$ such that $L_{*}\in\Kl^{2}$ and any finite subalgebra $M\inn L$ with $M=\gena{M_{1}}{L}$, we have
$\ded^{L}(M)\leq\delta_{3}(M)$.
\end{lem*}
%\begin{proofof}[the lemma]
%Consider the map $\map{\gamma_{\sss M}^{\sss L}}{\ftr{M}}{\ftr{L}}$, since $\pam{M}=
%\gamma_{\sss M}^{\sss L}\,\pam{L}$ we have that $\gamma_{\sss M}^{\sss L}$ maps
%$\ker\pam{M}=N^{3}(M)$ onto $\ker\pam{L}\cap\gam{M}{L}(F_{M})=N_{L}^{3}(M_{1})$ and that $\ker\gamma_{\sss M}^{\sss L}\inn N^{3}(M)$.

%Therefore $\dfp N_{L}^{3}(M_{1})
%=\dfp N^{3}(M)-\ka{M}{L}$ and  $\delta_{3}(M)-\ded^{L}(M)=\delta_{2}(M)-
%d_{2}^{L}(M)-\ka{M}{L}$.
%\end{proofof}

\item[]And this lemma relies essentially on the following improvement of the above
embedding result
\begin{teo*}
Let $A\quot B$ be a finite extension of algebras in the class $\Kl^{2}$ and $A=\ssc_{2}^{A}(B)$, then %$k_{B}^{A}:=
$\dfp(\ker\gam{B}{A})\leq-\delta_{2}(A\quot B)$.
\end{teo*}
%To use the statement above, first observe
%that if $B$ is a finite subalgebra of some $M$ in $\nla{2}$ and if $A$ is the selfsufficient closure  
%of $B$ in $M$, then since $\gam{B}{M}
%=\gam{B}{A}\gam{A}{M}$ and $A\zsu M$, we have $k_{B}^{M}=k_{B}^{A}$.
%Also since $A=\ssc_{2}^{M}(B)=\ssc_{2}^{A}(B)$, we have
%\begin{cor*}
%For any $M$ in $\nla{2}$ with $\sig{2}{2}$ and any finite subalgebra $B=\gena{B_{1}}{M}$
%we have $\ker\gam{B}{M}\leq\delta_{2}(B)-d_{2}^{M}(B)$ for any $M$.
%\end{cor*}

%The theorem above relies on the following crucial lemma.
%\begin{lem*}
%Let $A\quot C$ be an extension of $\nla{2}$-algebras with %$\dfp(A_{1}\quot C_{1})=1$ and
%$A_{1}=\gen{C_{1},a}$ for some $a$ in $A_{1}$ independent over $C_{1}$.

%Assume $\delta_{2}(A\quot C)\leq0$ and $\left(\tpl{\psi}{n}\right)$ is a basis
%for $N^{2}(A)$ over $N^{2}(C)$, where $\psi_{i}=[c_{i},a]-w_{i}$ for independent $\tpl{c}{n}$ in
%$C_{1}$ and $w_{i}$ in $\exs C_{1}$, then $k_{C}^{A}\leq\dfp N^{2}(\geno{\tpl{c}{n}})$.
%\end{lem*}
\end{itemize}

{\bf Amalgamation Issues}
\begin{itemize}
\item[]Sketch construction of the (asymmetric) free amalgam.
\item[]Unfortunately subaddittivity of $\ded^{M}$ fails in general. This being implied
by modularity of $N^{3}_{M}(-)$, and in particular true for subspaces $H_{1},K_{1}\inn M_{1}$ with
$$\gena{H_{1}}{F_{M}}\cap\gena{K_{1}}{F_{M}}=\gena{H_{1}\cap K_{1}}{F_{M}}.$$

To get the above modular condition for the free-lift is proved not to be sufficient in general the same
to be true one step below, that is if
$$\gena{H_{1}}{{M}}\cap\gena{K_{1}}{{M}}=\gena{H_{1}\cap K_{1}}{{M}}.$$

However this works if $H$ and $K$ are in free composition over their intersection,
this yields a free amalgam $L$ with $H\dsu L\nni K$ starting from $H\nni H\cap K \dsu K$.

Without subadditivity, we still cannot prove whether $L$ has locally positive $\delta_{3}$-deficiency.
%if we assume $H_{1}$ and $K_{1}$ to be ``$\cl_{a}$-closed'' in terms
%of solutions of $[a,X]-w$ for $w\in H_{2}$ and a fixed constant $a$ in the language.

%Since $\cl_{a}\inn\cl_{2}$, to pass from $H_{1}$ to $\cl_{a}(H_{1})$ seems
%effective in $\ded$-computations.

%\item[]One then try to amalgamate within the class
%$$\Kl^{3}_{a}=\{M\in\nla{3}\mid M_{*}\in\Kl^{2},\,M_{1}=\cl_{a}(M_{1}),\,\triv\dsu M\}.$$

\item[]A notion of minimal extension, although seemingly sound, is of no use
if transitivity of $\dsu$ fails.
\end{itemize}

\indent
{\bf Finitely Presented Groups}
\begin{itemize}
\item[]In ``homological'' group theory, very similar notions can be found, which surely add interesting motivation to
all the previous machinery.

%Definitions and results which follows may be found in {\em Robinson, A course in group theory, GTM}
%or in {} as well as, from the last author, in papers 

\item[]A {\em finitely presented} group $G$ is $(n,r)$-presented, if admits a presentation
with $n$ generators and $r$ relators. The {\em deficiency} of the group $G$ is defined as
$$\mathrm{def}(G)=\max(n-r\mid G\,\,\text{is $(n, r)$-presented}).$$

It is possible to estimate the deficiency of $G$ in terms of the {\em Schur multiplicator}
$H_{2}(G)=H_{2}(G,\Z)$, the second {\em homology group with integer coefficents} of $G$:
$$\text{def}(G)\leq r_{0}(G_{ab})-d(H_{2}(G))$$
here $d$ denotes the minimum cardinality of a set of generators and $r_{0}$ is the rank of an abelian group.
A group $G$ is said {\em effective} if its deficiency equals the right hand bound in the inequality above.

The following form for the second integral homology group of $G$ given by {\em Hopf's
formula} is very close indeed to our definitions:
$$H_{2}(G)=F^{\prime}\cap R\quot [F,R]$$
if $R\to F\to G$ presents $G$. The Schur multiplicator does not depend on the particular
presentation for $G$.

There exists a notion of Schur multiplicator with respect to a variety of groups $\mathcal{V}$:
$H^{\mathcal{V}}_{2}(G,B)$ for a right $G$-module $B$ and $G$ in $\mathcal{V}$.

If we also take coefficients in $\Fp$ we get
$$\mathrm{def_{\mathcal{V}}}(G)\leq\dfp(G_{ab})-\dfp H_{2}^{\mathcal{V}}(G,\Fp).$$
Where now Hopf formula for $H_{2}^{\mathcal{V}}(G)$ is computed with respect
to a $\mathcal{V}$-presentation of $G$.

If we compare this formulas with the predimensions above, we find in the first
place the abelianized group $G_{ab}$ as the weight one space in the
Lie algebra translation, which is exactly the case in the correspondance we mentioned at the beginning.

On the other hand, if we think of relations as being weighted according to the lower central series, the term $F^{\prime}\cap R\quot [F,R]$ automatically filters
all relations we actually needs and factors out repetitions.

In the scope of solving subadditivity for the difference above interpreted as predimension,
one may search for a relativized group homology $H_{2}(A;G)$ for subgroups $A$ of $G$,
and then try to compare terms $H_{2}(A;G)\cap H_{2}(B;G)$ and $H_{2}(A\cap B;G)$,
I fear this would give the same difficulties encountered above.

\item[]The following result points out the power of this second homology, especially in a
nilpotent context:
\begin{teo*}
Let $\phi$ be a group morphism of $G$ in $K$, if $\phi$
induces an isomorphism of $G_{ab}$ to $K_{ab}$ and an epimorphism
$\phi_{*}$ of $H_{2}(G)$ onto $H_{2}(K)$, then $\phi$ induces
isomorphisms of $G\quot\gamma_{i}(G)$ to $K\quot\gamma_{i}(K)$ for all
$i<\omega$.
\end{teo*}
Which has the corollary
\begin{teo*}
Let a group $G$ in $\mathcal{V}$ be $(n+r,r;\mathcal{V})$-presented, if $G_{ab}$
is generated by the $n$ element $\tpl{\bar x}{n}$ then $\tpl{x}{n}$ generate a $\mathcal{V}$-free subgroup of $G$.
\end{teo*}

\item[]The above also translate, with minor changes, to Lie algebras as well.

In particular for a presentation $\mathfrak{r}\to\mathfrak{f}\to\mathfrak{g}$ one has
$$H_{2}(\mathfrak{g})=\mathfrak{f}^{\prime}\cap\mathfrak{r}\quot[\mathfrak{f},
\mathfrak{r}].$$

In our graded case however $\mathfrak{r}\inn\mathfrak{f}^{\prime}$: the Schur multiplicator mods out the full relator ideal with respect to the {\em shifted} term
$[\mathfrak{f},\mathfrak{r}]$ which eliminates redundant terms.
%Hence $H_{2}(\mathfrak{g})$ is a generalised $N^{3}(\mathfrak{g})$.
